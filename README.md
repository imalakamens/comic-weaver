# Comic Weaver

Comic weaver is an app for comic collection management. Users will use The Weaver to add or remove items from their collection. Named after a family of small birds that create intricate nests, Comic Weaver allows users to add and remove comics from their collection for cataloguing, bragging and sharing.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.Js, Express, and MongoDb/Mongoose

## Getting Started
[Follow the link](https://comic-weaver.herokuapp.com/), log in, and start by adding a comic to your collection or an artist or writer to the database. Edit comics in your collection, or remove them. Worry not, other user's won't even be able to see books you've added so there's no need to hide your shame be proud of your "Weave"!

## Next Steps
I would like to add a "read/reading" feature for each comic as well as the ability to add photos of each comic(though I worry about storage space!)
