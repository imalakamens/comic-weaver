# Comic Weaver

Comic weaver is an app for comic collection management. Users will use The Weaver to add or remove items from their collection. Named after a family of small birds that create intricate nests, Comic Weaver allows users to add and remove comics from their collection for cataloguing, bragging and sharing.
