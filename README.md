HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.Js, Express, and MongoDb/Mongoose

## Getting Started
[Follow the link](https://comic-weaver.herokuapp.com/), log in, and start by adding a comic to your collection or an artist or writer to the database. Edit comics in your collection, or remove them - other users won't be able to modify books you've added!

## Next Steps
* Add a "read/reading" feature for each comic (this is actually already partially implemented in the model of user)
* Hide comics not added by logged in user
